Logged Pain Points
- Title: Home nav link is redundant
  - Category tags: Navigation, Clutter
  - Description: The "Home" item in the top navigation duplicates the "Snail Mail" brand link, which already routes to the dashboard. This redundancy adds visual noise without additional value.
  - Severity: Low
  - Impacted users: All users
  - Evidence: TBD
  - Proposed solution: Remove the "Home" nav item; keep the brand "Snail Mail" as the home link. Optionally add a tooltip labeled "Home" to the brand link for clarity.
  - Priority: P2
  - Status: New
  - Owner: TBD

- Title: Snail graphic is too constrained
  - Category tags: Visual Design, Clutter
  - Description: The snail graphic container is overly restricted and feels isolated. It should overlap with and sit behind other page components to create visual depth and make better use of the screen space.
  - Severity: Medium
  - Impacted users: All users
  - Evidence: TBD
  - Proposed solution: Allow the snail container to extend beyond its current boundaries, layer it beneath other components, and use z-index to create visual hierarchy and overlap effects.
  - Priority: P2s
  - Status: New
  - Owner: TBD
  - Date: 2025-12-29

- Title: Home page features are not linked to destination pages
  - Category tags: Navigation, Content
  - Description: Home page features or sections display information but lack clickable links that route users to the relevant pages (e.g., Compose, Inbox, Address Book, etc.). This forces users to navigate manually rather than discovering actions through the home page.
  - Severity: High
  - Impacted users: All users
  - Evidence: TBD
  - Proposed solution: Add clickable links or buttons to home page feature cards/sections that navigate to the corresponding pages (Compose, Inbox, Address Book, Settings, etc.). Consider card-level clicks or distinct CTA buttons.

Logged Pain Points
- Title: Community page is cluttered and not inviting
  - Category tags: Clutter, Visual Design, Content, UX
  - Description: The Community page feels dense and unwelcoming, lacking the warmth and accessibility expected from a community space. The layout is cluttered, making it difficult for users to engage or feel encouraged to participate.
  - Severity: High
  - Impacted users: All users
  - Evidence: TBD
  - Proposed solution: Redesign with clearer hierarchy, add welcoming messaging, reduce clutter, use inviting visual design (colors, imagery, whitespace), feature user stories or testimonials, and include clear CTAs for participation or connection.
